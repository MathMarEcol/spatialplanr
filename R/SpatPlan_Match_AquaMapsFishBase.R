# # Habitat definitions
# # "bathydemersal": Living and feeding on the bottom below 200 m.
# # "bathypelagic": Region of the oceanic zone between 1,000 m to 4,000 m; between the mesopelagic layer above and the abyssopelagic layer below. Living or feeding in open waters at depths between 1,000 and 4,000 m. In FishBase this term is used to include the depth range from 200 m to the bottom and thus the zones mesopelagic, bathypelagic and abyssopelagic.
# # "benthic": Dwelling on, or relating to, the bottom of a body of water; living on the bottom of the ocean and feeding on benthic organisms.
# # "benthopelagic": Living and feeding near the bottom as well as in midwaters or near the surface. Feeding on benthic as well as free swimming organisms. Many freshwater fish are opportunistic feeders that forage on the bottom as well as in midwater and near the surface, also pertaining to forms which hover or swim just over the floor of the sea, e.g. Halosauridae, Macrouridae, Moridae, Brotulidae; the depth zone about 100 metres off the bottom at all depths below the edge of the continental shelf.
# # "demersal": Sinking to or lying on the bottom; living on or near the bottom and feeding on benthic organisms
# # "epipelagic": The uppermost, normally photic layer of the ocean between the ocean surface and the thermocline, usually between depths of 0-200 m; living or feeding on surface waters or at midwater to depths of 200 m.
# # "epiphytic":
# # "host"
# # "others"
# # "pelagic": Living and feeding in the open sea; associated with the surface or middle depths of a body of water; free swimming in the seas, oceans or open waters; not in association with the bottom. Many pelagic fish feed on plankton. In FishBase, referring to surface or mid water from 0 to 200 m depth.
# # "pelagic-neritic": Inhabiting shallow coastal waters over the continental shelf.
# # "pelagic-oceanic": Pertaining to the open ocean beyond the continental shelf; living in the open ocean, offshore. Opposite of neritic.
# # "reef-associated": Living and feeding on or near coral reefs
# # "sessile": Organism being attached to a substrate.
